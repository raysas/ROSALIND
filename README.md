*This repository is made in the purpose of learning.*

[ROSALIND](https://rosalind.info/about/) is a bioinformatics platform that explores the many uses of python in solving algorithms and dealing with data.
It's divided to 5 sub-repositpries:
- **Python Village:** setting up python and learning beginner's tools that are of a good use later on
- **Bioinformatics Stronghold:** start digging through algorithms that are of good use in analyzing biological problems
- **Bioinformatics Armory:** solve problems with the use of software tools
- **Bioinformatics Textbook Track:** collection of exercises from Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzne.
*a version could be found [here](https://stepic.org).*
- **Algorithmic Heights:** focus on solving complex algorithms using python

et voila! Happy Coding!
